# NFTDemo
It's simple ethereum NFT demo project, and I do this for learning solidity and NFT. The Project using ipfs to store the pictures and picture's json information that used as NFT, then I pass the picture's or json's ipfs address into solidity smart contract to sell, which using ERC721 protocol.
It's worth mentioning that the artworks you buy do not belong to you because the artworks are stored in ipfs, and you don't have access of the account, so you do not own the NFT artworks you buy actually.
